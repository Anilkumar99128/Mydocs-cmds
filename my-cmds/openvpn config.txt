
Configuring Azure AD on a Linux machine typically involves using Azure AD authentication for user access. Here are the general steps to achieve this:

Register an Application in Azure AD:

Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > New registration.
Fill in the required information for the application, and note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.
Create a Client Secret:

In the registered application, go to Certificates & secrets.
Create a new client secret and note down the Value. Be sure to save this value securely as it will not be visible again.
Configure Permissions:

In the registered application, go to API permissions.
Add the necessary permissions. For Linux authentication, you may need at least User.Read. Grant admin consent if necessary.
Install Azure AD Authentication Libraries:

Install the necessary libraries on your Linux machine. For example, you might need to install the python3-pip package and then install the azure-identity library using pip.


sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install azure-identity
Modify OpenVPN Configuration:

Edit your OpenVPN server configuration file (usually located at /etc/openvpn/server.conf).

Add or modify the following lines to use the Azure AD authentication:


plugin /usr/lib/openvpn/openvpn-plugin-auth-azure-ad.so /etc/openvpn/azure-ad-auth-config.yml
Create a configuration file for Azure AD authentication (/etc/openvpn/azure-ad-auth-config.yml):

yaml
Copy code
tenantId: <Directory (tenant) ID>
clientId: <Application (client) ID>
clientSecret: <Client Secret>
Replace <Directory (tenant) ID>, <Application (client) ID>, and <Client Secret> with the values you obtained during the Azure AD application registration.

Restart OpenVPN:

Restart the OpenVPN service to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart openvpn
Test the Configuration:

Connect to the OpenVPN server and verify that Azure AD authentication is working as expected.
Please note that the exact steps may vary based on the Linux distribution and OpenVPN version you are using. Be sure to check the documentation for your specific setup.
