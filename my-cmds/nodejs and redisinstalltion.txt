N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
This error message is displayed when you try to update or install packages from an unsigned repository or a repository that has an invalid GPG key. This is a security feature of the Advanced Package Tool (APT) that prevents users from installing packages from untrusted sources.

To fix this issue, you should first make sure that the repository is valid and secure. You can check the validity of the repository by visiting its website and verifying that it is an official repository that is maintained by a trustworthy organization.

If you are sure that the repository is valid, you can enable it by creating a new file in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory with the repository information. For example, to add the Node.js repository to your system, you can create a file called nodesource.list in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory with the following content:

arduino
Copy code
deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_12.x focal main
deb-src https://deb.nodesource.com/node_12.x focal main
After creating the file, you should import the GPG key for the repository using the following command:

arduino
Copy code
curl -s https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
Finally, you can update the package lists and install the packages from the repository with the following commands:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
Note that it is important to only add and enable repositories from trusted sources to avoid security issues.
