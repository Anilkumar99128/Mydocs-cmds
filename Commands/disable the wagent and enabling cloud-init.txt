Disable SWAP creation in waagent configuration
If the SWAP creation is configured in /etc/waagent.conf, you must disable it.
1.	Disable resource disk formatting and SWAP configuration within /etc/waagent.conf, because this task is now handled by Cloud-Init. Set the parameters as follows:
Configuration Copy 
 
# Format if unformatted. If 'n', resource disk will not be mounted.
ResourceDisk.Format=n

# Create and use SWAPfile on resource disk.
ResourceDisk.EnableSWAP=n

#Mount point for the resource disk
ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt

#Size of the SWAPfile.
ResourceDisk.SWAPSizeMB=0
2.	Restart the Azure Linux Agent. See How to update the Azure Linux Agent on a VM for information about the restart commands for different Linux distributions.
Create a SWAP partition
You can create a SWAP partition by using one of the following option.
Create a SWAP partition under the resource or custom disk path by using scripts 
1.	Create a SWAP creation script named swap.sh under /var/lib/cloud/scripts/per-boot with the following script:
#!/bin/sh
# Percent of space on the ephemeral disk to dedicate to swap. Here 30% is being used. Modify as appropriate.
PCT=0.3
# Location of the swap file. Modify as appropriate based on the location of the ephemeral disk.
LOCATION=/mnt
if [ ! -f ${LOCATION}/swapfile ]
then
    # Get size of the ephemeral disk and multiply it by the percent of space to allocate
    size=$(/bin/df -m --output=target,avail | /usr/bin/awk -v percent="$PCT" -v pattern=${LOCATION} '$0 ~ pattern {SIZE=int($2*percent);print SIZE}')
    echo "$size MB of space allocated to swap file"
     # Create an empty file first and set correct permissions
    /bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=${LOCATION}/swapfile bs=1M count=$size
    /bin/chmod 0600 ${LOCATION}/swapfile
    # Make the file available to use as swap
    /sbin/mkswap ${LOCATION}/swapfile
fi
# Enable swap
/sbin/swapon ${LOCATION}/swapfile
/sbin/swapon -a
# Display current swap status
/sbin/swapon -s
 
1.	The script will be executed on every boot and allocates 30% of the available space in the resource disk. You can customize the values based on your situation.
2.	Make the script executable:
Bash Copy 
 
chmod +x /var/lib/cloud/scripts/per-boot/swap.sh
3.	Stop and start the VM. Stopping and starting the VM is only necessary the first time after you create the SWAP file.
