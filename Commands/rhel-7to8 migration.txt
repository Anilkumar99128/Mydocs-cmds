    3. Multiple devel kernels installed
    4. Detected partitions mounted with the "noexec" option, preventing a successful in-place upgrade.
    5. Missing required answers in the answer file
    6. Missing required answers in the answer file

HIGH and MEDIUM severity reports:
    1. Packages available in excluded repositories will not be installed
    2. Packages not signed by Red Hat found on the system
    3. Difference in Python versions and support in RHEL 8
    4. SSSD Domain "INTBIB.COM": sudo rules containing wildcards will stop working.
    5. GRUB2 core will be automatically updated during the upgrade

Risk Factor: high (inhibitor)
Title: Leapp detected loaded kernel drivers which have been removed in RHEL 8. Upgrade cannot proceed.
Summary: Support for the following RHEL 7 device drivers has been removed in RHEL 8:
     - floppy
     - pata_acpi
	 
	 rmmod  floppy
	 rmmod pata_acpi

[root@dbsuatsftp ~]# more /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt

Summary: OpenSSH is configured to use removed mac hmac-ripemd160. This MAC was removed from OpenSSH and if present the sshd daemon will not start in RHEL 8
Remediation: [hint] Remove the following MACs from sshd_config: hmac-ripemd160
 
 remove the mac and restart sshd

Remediation: [hint] Remove all but one kernel-devel packages before running Leapp again.
[command] yum -y remove kernel-devel-3.10.0-1160.95.1.el7 kernel-devel-3.10.0-1160.105.1.el7
yum -y remove kernel-devel-3.10.0-1160.95.1.el7 kernel-devel-3.10.0-1160.105.1.el7

remove the devel kernel

Title: Detected partitions mounted with the "noexec" option, preventing a successful in-place upgrade.
Summary: Leapp detected that the /var mountpoint is mounted with the "noexec" option, which prevents binaries necessary for the upgrade from being executed. The upgrade
 process cannot continue with /var mounted using the "noexec" option.
Remediation: [hint] Temporarily remove the "noexec" option from /var entry in /etc/fstab until the system is upgraded, and remount the partition without the "noexec" op
tion.

Title: Packages available in excluded repositories will not be installed
Summary: 4 packages will be skipped because they are available only in target system repositories that are intentionally excluded from the list of repositories used dur
ing the upgrade. See the report message titled "Excluded target system repositories" for details.
The list of these packages:
- libnsl2-devel (repoid: codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms)
- python3-pyxattr (repoid: codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms)
- rpcgen (repoid: codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms)
- rpcsvc-proto-devel (repoid: codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms)
Key: 2437e204808f987477c0e9be8e4c95b3a87a9f3e
----------------------------------------



Risk Factor: high
Title: Packages not signed by Red Hat found on the system
Summary: The following packages have not been signed by Red Hat and may be removed during the upgrade process in case Red Hat-signed packages to be removed during the u
pgrade depend on them:
- atop
- ds_agent
- zabbix-agent


Title: Difference in Python versions and support in RHEL 8
Summary: In RHEL 8, there is no 'python' command. Python 3 (backward incompatible) is the primary Python version and Python 2 is available with limited support and limi
ted set of packages. If you no longer require Python 2 packages following the upgrade, please remove them. Read more here: https://red.ht/rhel-8-python
Remediation: [hint] Please run "alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3" after upgrade

alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3

Risk Factor: high
Title: SSSD Domain "INTBIB.COM": sudo rules containing wildcards will stop working.
Summary: Default value of ldap_sudo_include_regexp changed from true to false for performance reason.
Remediation: [hint] If you use sudo rules with wildcards, set this option to true explicitly.
Key: 9eec7fca8e72775346c4ff2fa772ea20d9f42717



Title: GRUB2 core will be automatically updated during the upgrade
Summary: On legacy (BIOS) systems, GRUB2 core (located in the gap between the MBR and the first partition) cannot be updated during the rpm transaction and Leapp has to
 initiate the update running "grub2-install" after the transaction. No action is needed before the upgrade. After the upgrade, it is recommended to check the GRUB confi
guration.
